# my-improved-version-of-sm64dse
This is an edited version of sm64dse 2.3.5 by Fiachra

The .exe file is in bin/release

Changelog:
-invisible pole now has an indicator for its height

-custom Model for the StarMarker

-painting shows its tilt properly

-exit objects show their whole trigger area, also tilted

-path objects draw the node-connecting lines when highlighted

-added buttons for copying and pasting the objects coordinates


Changes v1.1:
-new interface for editing object properties

-paths now show up as closed if they are

-double clicking an object in the objectlist snaps the camera to it (for example usefull to find the level entrances)

-in the 3d model tab you can select single areas to show up (pretty usefull to see what is going to be visible when entering a door)

-some BugFixes

Changes v1.2:
-views now have index numbers like entrances

-nodes are now ordered by their path

-adding new PathNodes is much easier

-the parameters for the paths startindex and its length are removed as they aren't needed and would screw up everything

-saving won't screw up your paths anymore (at least i hope so)
